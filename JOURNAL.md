This is my journal of the design and building process of **Alarm system V1**.

## 10/8/2025 - Setup + Design Part 1  

I started getting to work on the alarm,  I drew a few images of my ideas, and then I got set up. It was hard for absolutely, thinking about using other things like face and sound sensors. I tested some of these but they seem like they are not very precise so im using a 4 by 4 key pad to enter the code. My next step is probably learning a bit of Kicad and doing some tutorial, I stared working on the alarm in Tinkercad I have to redo wiring thats why there none in the picture. I'll work on programing soon. The next steps are to progam the base model and wire it. ![Screenshot 2025-10-08 204840.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f477a9483c7e10370e151fc7c48d21297a2d6917/Screenshot%202025-10-08%20204840.png)
  

## 10/9/2025 7 AM - Design  

I decided to move from a key module to and 4 by 4 pad. I didn't mention that in my first entry. So I started cost calculations to keep it as cheap as possible. This is also why I moved from a key module to an 4 by 4 so far I need

1. An arduino r3 nano doesn't have enough pins
2. LCD 2 by 16
3. 4 by 4 matrix keypad
4. buzzer
5. red and green LED

## 10/9/2025 8 PM - Wired the components and made scematic  

I fixed my mistakes in the wiring and got inspiration from some videos https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R63Q5_ygemM. I decided to make it spin a servo motor so it can spin a gear I will attach to it. I also made a schematic and figured out my the materials I will need next is learning Kicad and making the PCB, I didn't think it would take me too long but this took me almost 3 hour![Screenshot 2025-10-09 203204.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f88cf1ca01244144440af769e118019da52c4831/Screenshot%202025-10-09%20203204.png)
