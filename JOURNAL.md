## 10/8/2025 - Setup + Design Part 1  

I started getting to work on the alarm,  I drew a few images of my ideas, and then I got set up. It was hard for absolutely, thinking about using other things like face and sound sensors. I tested some of these but they seem like they are not very precise so im using a 4 by 4 key pad to enter the code. My next step is probably learning a bit of Kicad and doing some tutorial, I stared working on the alarm in Tinkercad I have to redo wiring thats why there none in the picture. I'll work on programing soon. The next steps are to progam the base model and wire it. ![Screenshot 2025-10-08 204840.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f477a9483c7e10370e151fc7c48d21297a2d6917/Screenshot%202025-10-08%20204840.png)
  

## 10/9/2025 7 AM - Design  

I decided to move from a key module to and 4 by 4 pad. I didn't mention that in my first entry. So I started cost calculations to keep it as cheap as possible. This is also why I moved from a key module to an 4 by 4 so far I need

1. An arduino r3 nano doesn't have enough pins
2. LCD 2 by 16
3. 4 by 4 matrix keypad
4. buzzer
5. red and green LED

## 10/9/2025 8 PM - Wired the components and made scematic  

I fixed my mistakes in the wiring and got inspiration from some videos https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R63Q5_ygemM. I decided to make it spin a servo motor so it can spin a gear I will attach to it. I also made a schematic and figured out my the materials I will need next is learning Kicad and making the PCB, I didn't think it would take me too long but this took me almost 3 hour![Screenshot 2025-10-09 203204.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM0MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f88cf1ca01244144440af769e118019da52c4831/Screenshot%202025-10-09%20203204.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 5 PM - Changed the design  

decided to turn it from a house alarm to a vault, I realized while driving to my soccer game (6-0 light work) that the servo could snag a door in locked position so I decided to make it a vault. I don't need to make any changes to my design so next is learning Kicad. I might be cooked . . . ![WIN_20251012_17_43_44_Pro.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c60274ab1b682366e2f2b2d455c1dba4ccbced22/WIN_20251012_17_43_44_Pro.jpg)
  

## 10/12/2025 8 PM - Learned Kicad  

Got on the Kicad grind, locked in, and made some stuff. I followed a tutorial, It was easier that expected but I made some dumb ahh mistakes so it took a while next, i'll make the PCB, and then I'm done. I'm planning on finishing by Wednesday this week.![Screenshot 2025-10-12 203814.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTk0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6ade544b8ff8d0746fa9e1337712897c128f43fc/Screenshot%202025-10-12%20203814.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 - Last few thing  

I did the last few steps I wrote my READ.me file and uploaded what i need I won't be buying a PCB and will use my own money to get the parts all I need is a servo motor, I really enjoyed doing this going back and reading my logs gives me a sense of completion I have all my parts to build the vault ready even though I think i'll have to fix something.![WIN_20251024_17_18_21_Pro](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5d55ce9bf95aa0e31369365c4f34a0ce2a7478c4/WIN_20251024_17_18_21_Pro.jpg)
