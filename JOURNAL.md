## 10/9/2025 - Setup + Design Part 1  

I started getting to work on the alarm,  I drew a few images of my ideas, and then I got set up. It was hard for absolutely, thinking about using other things like face and sound sensors. I tested some of these but they seem like they are not very precise so im using a 4 by 4 key pad to enter the code. My next step is probably learning a bit of Kicad and doing some tutorial, I stared working on the alarm in Tinkercad I have to redo wiring thats why there none in the picture. I'll work on programing soon. The next steps are to progam the base model and wire it. ![Screenshot 2025-10-08 204840.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f477a9483c7e10370e151fc7c48d21297a2d6917/Screenshot%202025-10-08%20204840.png)
